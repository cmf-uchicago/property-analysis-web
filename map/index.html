            <h2>What is equity in property taxes?</h2>
            <p>
              Homes are supposed to be assessed based on how much they would sell for (the fair market value), independent of the home's worth.
              Utilizing a nationwide set of property sales and assessments from <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/">CoreLogic</a>, we were able to compare assessments to millions of sales.
              In all fifty states, lower-value homes were on average assessed at higher rates than higher-value homes.
            </p>
            <p>
              This relationship can be seen to the right. A value of 1 means that low and high value homes were on average assessed at the same rate.
              Values below 1 (shaded in reds and yellows) are <b>regressive</b> areas where lower value homes are assessed at higher rates than high value homes.
              For example, in the least equitable state (Alabama), low value homes are assessed at over twice the rate of high value homes on average.
              Property assessments are roughly converted into property taxes---so in Alabama these lower value homes likely pay a tax rate much higher that of high value homes.

              Note that for some counties (black or clear) sales were either unavailable or too infrequent for analysis.
